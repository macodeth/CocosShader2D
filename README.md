## Shaders
- Parallax: infinite scrolling sprite, works even if texture doesn't have CLAMP wrapping mode
- Outline: add a simple outline to sprite
- Barrel Distortion (borrowed from Phaser)
- Pixelate (borrowed from Phaser)
- Flag: flag waving animation (inspired by a Godot shader)
- Fake Perspective: make sprite to have a fake 3d look (based on a Godot shader)
- Wipe Horizontal: simple appear/disappear animation in horizontal axis
- Wipe Vertical: simple appear/disappear animation in vertical axis
- Rainbow: rainbow color looping
- 2-Color Gradient: horizontal gradient using 2 colors
- 3-Color Gradient: horizontal gradient using 3 colors
